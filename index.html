	<h1>Happy Birthday, Amore!</h1>
	<div class="frameText" id="first">
		<p>Congratulations! 
		<br>You've solved your first and main task. It's not over though, it's just the beginning! You will have four more parts to find. Each part contains a password that opens a new clue here, on this "Website". (I need to practice my programming :D)</p>
		<p>
			So, let's start with an easy one. The first little thing (and a password inside) you will find in a place that is already dusty and not really used, unfortunately. It's directly connected to music. I'd really like this place to stop being lonely and dusty and start to sound again. 
			<br><br> P.S. We can also torture one singing neighbour if I'll try that!
		</p>
		<button id="b1" onclick="enterPas1()">Password 1</button>
	</div>
	<div class="frameText" id="second">
		<p>
			Yey! Good on you! Okay. It's time to start being serious. You'll have to do some stairs to get this one. You'll need to open some drawers of your childhood memories.
			<br>What about the present you'll find there? Actually, in the rest 3 parts you'll find the same kind of things, combining some taste and emotions (I hope). This one is connected to the part of the Earth where there are just two countries we'd be curious to visit. This in particular is a bit more isolated one.
		</p>
		<button id="b2" onclick="enterPas2()">Password Ni</button>
	</div>
	<div class="frameText" id="third">
		<p>
			There were a lot of snacks, weren’t there? Now let’s get a bit more liquidy and a bit more worldly. Where to find the bottles, you could be wondering…
			<br>Boh. While you’re thinking, I can just wish you another thing: Live long, and prosper, amore. Live long, and prosper…

		</p>
		<button id="b3" onclick="enterPas3()">Password Wej</button>
	</div>
	<div class="frameText" id="forth">
		<p>So, it's just one little part left. Fantastic job!
			<br>The last thing is pretty unusual. I'm not even sure If you'll truly like the taste. But I know you like trying new weird jellyfish-style stuff!
			<br> I won't torture you with searching anymore. Just open my part of the wardrobe and look on the shelf.
		</p>
		<button id="b4" onclick="enterPas4()">Finished!</button>
	</div>
	<div class="frameText" id="fifth">
		<p>I just want to say that I love you to the moon and back. Kiss!
